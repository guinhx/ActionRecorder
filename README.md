# Action Recorder

Hi, I hope you all are well!

This is a project for creating a macro, aimed at those who need to automate some repetitive tasks.

The idea came from a personal need and I didn't like the ones I found for my purpose, the development of my own application was so pleasant that I decided to make it available to everyone.

The project is currently meeting the initial requirement, and I've now also reached the point of starting the step of refactoring some parts to improve the porformance, so keep following the development and put it to good use.
